## Bugs/Issues Found  

| Bug ID | Description | Steps to Reproduce | Severity (1-5) | Comments |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| BUG-001 | The registration form appears to simulate successful registration without sending any data to a backend service | Fill a error-free registration form and monitor network trafic - the page only validated the fields and sends a GET instead of POST request to the backend to display the success messagge | 5/5 | Should send a POST request with a encrypted data to the BE and then it should validate and return the success page |
| BUG-002 | Registration form security risk - Password is NOT hidden in the input element in page script | Enter a password, open dev tools and locate password input element | 5/5 | Value should be hidden |

## Room for improvement
1. System to show log in button after the registration, instead of Go To Registration.
2. Use strong password suggestion google plugin.
3. Password strength meter for better UX.
4. Before successfull registration, make the user to confirm the email.
5. Success message baloon for better UX.
